# Generative-Art
For Art 210 final art project.

Drawing_driver.py is the main script which basically takes in input from device microphone, analyzes the most dominant frequency, and draws
different things on a canvas using Python's Turtle library. This script is an instance of generative art, art created by a program that a person
doesn't necessarily have complete control over.

You should theoretically be able to use the script if you clone the repo and pip install using the requirements.txt file. I had trouble with PyAudio installation so that is the only thing you would have to install with pip manually or with a work around if you have issues with pip install.
