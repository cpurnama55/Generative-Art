# Generative-Art
For Art 210 final art project.

Drawing_driver.py is the main script which basically takes in input from device microphone, analyzes the most dominant frequency, and draws
different things on a canvas using Python's Turtle library. This script is an instance of generative art, art created by a program that a person
doesn't necessarily have complete control over.
